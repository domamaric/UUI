Solution for four programming assignments in Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (Uvod u umjetnu inteligenciju) course at [FER](https://www.fer.unizg.hr/).
 - In the first lab assignment we will analyse state space search problems and the complexity of various blind and heuristic search algorithms.
 - In the second lab assignment we will implement an automated reasoning system based on refutation resolution. The problem that we will deal with throughout the instructions will be an implementation of a system based on refutation resolution algorithm that will assist you during cooking.
 - In the third lab assignment we will implement the decision tree algorithm and analyse the problems and extensions of this machine learning algorithm.
 - The topics of the fourth lab assignment are neural networks and the generational genetic algorithm. The task of the lab assignment is to implement the code for learning an artificial neural network by means of a genetic algorithm
