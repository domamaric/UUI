# Introduction to Artificial Intelligence Project

This repository contains the solutions for four programming assignments in the "Introduction to Artificial Intelligence" (Uvod u umjetnu inteligenciju) cours eat [FER](https://www.fer.unizg.hr/).

## Project Overview

Project also contains `aco` folder which contains Ant colony optimization algorithm which is used to solve traveling salesman problem. Task is **not** part of laboratory assignments. I opted
to try and implement it for practice purposes. Folder contains one test case.

### Lab Assignments

1. **State Space Search Analysis**
   - Analyze state space search problems and the complexity of various blind and heuristic search algorithms.

2. **Automated Reasoning System**
   - Implement an automated reasoning system based on refutation resolution.
   - Address a problem related to cooking, applying the refutation resolution algorithm to assist in the process.

3. **Decision Tree Algorithm**
   - Implement the decision tree algorithm for machine learning.
   - Analyze the problems and extensions associated with this algorithm.

4. **Neural Networks and Genetic Algorithm**
   - Explore neural networks and the generational genetic algorithm.
   - Implement code for learning an artificial neural network using a genetic algorithm.

## Getting Started
